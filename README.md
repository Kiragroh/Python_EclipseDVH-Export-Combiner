Nobody likes the Eclipse DVH-Export. The format is not nice for further processing. 

The provided Python-Script can combine all exports in the same folder and build one Excel-Sheet with all the data und one Excel-Sheet with specific OARs.

Note: The script is only compatible with english DVH-exports. The export has the language of the Eclipse-user that exported.
